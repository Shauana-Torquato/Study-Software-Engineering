    Initial Considerations

    This is a document that works for practcing HTML skills, solidify theoric knowledge about MVC architecture and develop my English skills
    This is a material composed by lessons from college and personal research on books and material obteined online
    My first language is Portugues and I'm writing and organizing here what I originaly handwrote as studz material in my native language.

    What is the MVC architecture

    In a simple way of explaining, an MVC architecture is an architetural pattern/solution for better organizing and dividing the responsabilities that zour code will need to assist, specially when working in a Web Software Development.
    This architectural way of thinking is divided into three areas. Let's think about it as a real architectural project for a house. When we hire an archtect to work for our house project, it's because we want good aesthetic with efitiency and the best and smartest functionalities for zour house, with the best organization, 
    something that makes sense for zou to solve your dailz routine and at same time that is not confusing for zour visual perspective, easy seen - easy act. And the MVC archtecture says "hey, it makes sense just have it organiyed in 3 layers", like it makes sense to organize de areas in a house.
    So the MVC archtecture is the organization of responsabilities for areas, being the areas the Model, the View and the Controller - MVC.

    And what is the meaning of each lazer?

    Easy! The M - Model stands for all the data manipulation, the V - View goes for all interection with the user, and the C - Controllers is self explainatory, controller, controllers control! It's making the conections, being the control, the communication betwen the rooms.
    we will get deeper on the layers but first we need to cover some more topics about the MVC architecture itself.

    So WHEN should I use the MVC Architecture?

    whenever you need to be more precise, have more control over the generated HTML than the allowed/avaiable through the already working controllers and webforms. This way,
